        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">This Privacy Policy describes how Smart Halal Finder ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        ---

        <h2 class="text-3xl">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Smart Halal Finder app is designed with your privacy in mind. We aim to collect only the information necessary to provide our core services.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Images Uploaded by Users:</strong> When you use the App to analyze food ingredients, you will upload images of product packaging. These images are processed to extract text for ingredient analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Ingredient List Data:</strong> The text extracted from your uploaded images, as well as any edits or additions you make to the ingredient list within the App, constitutes the ingredient list data. This data is sent to our AI service (Gemini API) for classification.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Data (Non-Personal):</strong> We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data to understand how the App is used, identify common issues, and improve its performance and features. This data does not identify you personally and includes information such as app crashes, general feature usage, and device type (e.g., Android version). We use standard analytics tools for this purpose (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase, if integrated).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>We DO NOT collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identifying information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.</li>
            <li>Any sensitive personal data.</li>
            <li>Any information that could be used to directly identify you as an individual.</li>
        </ul>

        ---

        <h2 class="text-3xl">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide Core App Functionality:</strong> The images and ingredient list data you provide are essential for the App to perform its primary function: converting images of ingredient lists into text and then classifying those ingredients as "Halal," "Haram," or "Not Sure" using the Gemini API.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve App Performance:</strong> Anonymous and aggregated analytics data helps us understand how the App performs, identify bugs or areas for improvement, and enhance the user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>To Communicate with Our AI Service (Gemini API):</strong> Your ingredient list data is sent to the Gemini API for processing and classification. This is a crucial part of the App's functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        ---

        <h2 class="text-3xl">3. How Your Information is Shared</h2>
        <p>Your information is shared only in limited circumstances as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With the Gemini API:</strong> The ingredient list data (text extracted from images and user edits) is sent to the Gemini API for classification. We do not send images directly to the Gemini API for classification; only the parsed text. The Gemini API is a service provided by Google, and its own privacy policy governs their handling of data. We encourage you to review Google's privacy policy for more information.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated and Anonymous Data:</strong> We may share aggregated and anonymized usage data with third parties for research, analysis, or marketing purposes. This data cannot be used to identify any individual user.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency request).</li>
        </ul>

        ---

        <h2 class="text-3xl">4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We do not store your images or ingredient list data on our servers after the classification result is delivered to your device. The data is processed in real-time and then discarded from our systems. Analytics data is retained in an aggregated and anonymized format as long as necessary for analytical purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the information we process against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</li>
        </ul>

        ---

        <h2 class="text-3xl">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This App integrates with the Gemini API, a service provided by Google. Your use of the App and the data processed through the Gemini API are also subject to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services.</p>

        ---

        <h2 class="text-3xl">6. Limitation of Liability and Accuracy of Results</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Guarantees on Classification Accuracy:</strong> The Halal classification provided by the Smart Halal Finder app is generated by an Artificial Intelligence model. While we strive for accuracy, AI models can make errors, and the interpretation of Halal dietary laws can be complex and subject to various scholarly opinions.</li>
                <li><strong>Information for Guidance Only:</strong> The results provided by the App ("Halal," "Haram," or "Not Sure") are for <strong>informational guidance only</strong> and should not be considered definitive religious rulings or legal advice.</li>
                <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> Users are ultimately responsible for verifying the Halal status of food products, especially for critical dietary needs or religious observances. We strongly recommend consulting with qualified religious scholars or reputable Halal certification bodies for any definitive Halal rulings.</li>
                <li><strong>No Liability for Errors or Damages:</strong> <strong>We shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the Halal classification results provided by the App, nor for any loss, damage, or harm arising from reliance on such results or any use of the App. By using this App, you acknowledge and agree that you use it at your own risk.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
